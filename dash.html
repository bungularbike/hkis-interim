				<h4>What is Interim?</h4>
				<p>Interim is a weeklong, off-campus learning experience for all four years of High School. This alternative education program features a range of courses, but each weaves a number of Student Learning Results into the course experience. The program thus forms an integral part of the high school curriculum and is a graduation requirement for all High School students. The diverse Interim program offerings include community service, outdoor adventure and cross-cultural learning in Africa, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Mainland China, Europe, Hong Kong, and India.</p>
				<h4>Purpose and Goals</h4>
				<p>Interim is a carefully constructed program that presents students with many challenges and opportunities for personal growth. The Interim experience is designed to help students:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Build relationships and interactions with other students and faculty members.</li>
					<li>Cultivate a spirit of community.</li>
					<li>Expand exposure to diverse cultures and traditions.</li>
					<li>Work as a member of a team.</li>
					<li>Develop communication and leadership skills, self-reliance and compassion.</li>
					<li>Venture out of their physical, emotional and intellectual comfort zones.</li>
					<li>Discover new talents and interests.</li>
					<li>Gain greater self-knowledge and a richer understanding of the world around them.</li>
					<li>Grow in responsibility and independence.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class = "mb-0">While some offerings demand explicit contributions to the communities that host them, all offerings compel students to draw upon the values they have developed at home and school as they encounter new situations and novel challenges. Students emerge from the program with a more profound sense of self, an enriched appreciation of human diversity, and deeper insight into the faith, traditions and cultural values that inspire compassion and humility. Ultimately, participation in the program grants students the very real satisfaction that they have taken responsibility for their own learning.</p>

			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "communication">
				<h4>Communication Policy</h4>
				<p>We encourage students to be immersed in their Interim experience, so we recommend that Interim sponsors collect student cell phones prior to boarding their flights. We appreciate your support with this, and ask that you <i>do not contact your child directly during the week of Interim.</i></p>
				<p>Parent contact for emergency communications during Interim week should be through Mrs. Sue Harvey, Coordinator of Academic Programs. Mrs. Harvey will be in regular contact with teachers throughout the week of Interim and she will update the Interim websites with information as necessary.</p>
				<p>If there are any important parent communications for the student, please contact Mrs. Harvey and she will relay the information through the trip sponsor. Similarly, if there are any important communications from the child, they will be instructed to relay the information through the trip sponsor who will be in contact with Mrs. Harvey.</p>
				<h4>Before Interim Week</h4>
				<p>Please contact the trip sponsor. All relevant trip information, including trip sponsor contact info, is located on Schoology.</p>
				<h4>During Interim Week</h4>

			</div>
			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "studentResponsibilities">
				<h4>Pre-Interim</h4>
				<p>Positive interaction among students, faculty, guides and local people is a hallmark of all Interim courses. It is unacceptable for students to inconvenience others, or jeopardize the safety of the group. Students must demonstrate to their Interim sponsors that they are well suited to the course, are adequately prepared, and that they will be supportive of the group during the duration of the Interim course. If, during pre-Interim meetings and training sessions, students have not demonstrated adequate preparation and responsible behavior, they may be reassigned to a local Interim course. In such cases, no refund will be provided.</p>
				<h6>Pre-Interim meetings:</h6>
				<p>Students are required to attend all scheduled pre-Interim meetings and required training sessions. Failure to attend will jeopardize a student's participation in the desired course and they may even be reassigned to another Interim at parent expense.</p>
				<h4>During Interim Week</h4>
				<h6>BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS: For more detailed information, please consult the online Interim Handbook.</h6>
				<p>All HKIS school rules (as stated in the Student Handbook) are in effect for the duration of Interim week, both in- and out-of-Hong Kong courses. The regular prohibitions regarding disobedience, tobacco, illegal non-prescription drugs and alcohol will be in effect at all times. Deliberate curfew violations or going to “off limits” areas will not be tolerated, and all laws of the local country must be obeyed. Interim sponsors, in consultation with the administration, have the full authority to send home a student whose conduct is unacceptable or compromises the safety of the group. If it is necessary to send a student home, it will be at the parents’ expense.</p>
				<h4>Post-Interim Week</h4>
				<p>Upon their return from Interim, students will culminate their experience in the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete a 250-500 word reflection due 8 a.m. on Tuesday, March 17, 2020</li>
					<li>Share their newly developed skills as part of a presentation during Interim Parent Exhibition Night at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 18, 2020.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Failure to complete post Interim requirements or attend this event means that students have not completed their Interim requirements in order to earn a credit for graduation.</p>

			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "risk">
				<h4>ACTIVITIES, EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES WITHIN EACH COURSE ARE CATEGORIZED INTO ONE OF FOUR RISK LEVELS:</h4>
				<h5>Level 1: Low risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Students have received teacher approval to operate the equipment or proceed with the activity, and</li>
					<li>Students will not be hindered or impeded while using the equipment or engaging in the activity.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Level 2: Medium risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a degree of risk of injury to a student using this equipment or engaging in this activity to the extent that all the risk cannot be eliminated;</li>
					<li>Students require a safe working space to be able to operate the equipment or engage in the activity; and</li>
					<li>Personal protective equipment may be required to further reduce the risk of injury.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Level 3: High risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a high risk of injury to the student or other persons if the equipment or procedures described in the activity are not employed in the prescribed manner;</li>
					<li>The teacher should maintain close supervision of all aspects of this activity; and</li>
					<li>There is a need for the teacher and/or student to operate in a defined area.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Level 4: Very high risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul class = "mb-0">
					<li>There is a high risk of injury to the student or other persons if the equipment or procedures described in the activity are not employed in the prescribed manner;</li>
					<li>An injury sustained during this activity could result in a permanent disability or death;</li>
					<li>A high level of supervision by the teacher is required (a maximum of one student at any one time working with teacher guidance may be appropriate); and</li>
					<li>The activity is undertaken in a defined, restricted area.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "safety">
				<h4>SAFETY INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>The nature and purpose of our Interim courses may expose students to a degree of risk not typical of regular on-campus classes or activities. While courses involving physical activity and exploration are not risk-free, physical safety is of paramount importance as courses are planned and take place. All trips are rated on an Activity Risk Level to help students and parents choose appropriate trips.</p>
				<p>Prior to leaving Hong Kong, teachers confirm the availability of medical facilities in the host country, make certain that phones or other emergency communication is available, and brief students on how to minimize their risk. Additionally, the following guidelines are in place for Interim trips with certain activities:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For white water rafting:
						<ul>
							<li>no rafting on a river above Class Four rating on the AWA International Whitewater Rating Scale</li>
							<li>students must be in good physical condition</li>
							<li>the guiding company will be experienced and reputable</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>For “water” Interim courses (SCUBA diving, kayaking, snorkeling, surfing and sailing), students must:
						<ul>
							<li>pass a minimum 25-meter swimming test</li>
							<li>spend appropriate ‘in-pool’ training time prior to departure</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Trekking – attendance at training sessions may be mandatory - please check trip info page for more information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Interim sponsors carry a first aid kit that contains typical items that might be needed. They also have access to an emergency telephone number where they can get medical advice while outside the country. For more serious medical issues, emergency evacuation is available.</p>
				<p>Some Interim courses may have additional medical requirements. For further information, see the individual Trip pages for specific courses you are considering. Courses that require rigorous physical exercise or special skills may also require mandatory pre-trip training or assessment. For information about recommended immunizations or boosters for a specific country, please consult the CDC website here.</p>
				<h6>As Interim sponsors need to be aware of contact information, any medical issues, physical conditions or allergies, parents are required to keep all family details and medical information updated on <a href = "https://hkis.powerschool.com" target = "_blank" style = "font-family: Futura Bold">Powerschool</a> (after logging in, look on the top left side). Completion of an additional medical form with any current and temporary information is required just prior to Interim week.</h6>
				<br>
				<h4>INSURANCE INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>A comprehensive travel insurance package (including medical evacuation) covers all Interim program activities and is included in the Interim fee. As with most travel insurance policies, pre-existing medical conditions are not covered. Please ensure that individual concerns are addressed by contacting your personal insurance agents. Students attending the local Hong Kong Interims are covered under the same policy.</p>
				<p class = "mb-0">Should you wish to provide additional travel insurance for your child via your own insurance broker, then please do so. For questions about the insurance coverage, please contact Joanna Lin at <a href = "mailto:jlin@hkis.edu.hk">jlin@hkis.edu.hk</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "security">
				<h5>Be assured that HKIS takes the security of the trip sponsors and students very seriously.</h5>
				<p>Trip locations are chosen to politically stable regions and only after consultation with US State Department and other sources of relevant travel information. Whenever possible, first hand information about a region is given high priority, either from the teachers themselves, or through contacts with other schools or organizations.</p>
				<p>Copies of passport information, HK ID's, itineraries and emergency contact details are hand-carried by the trip sponsors with a second copy available to administrators at HKIS. Teachers are briefed about what to do in an emergency and have all direct contact information for staff at HKIS. They also have the authority to make decisions, change the itinerary, or do whatever might be necessary to ensure the safety of the students in their charge. At all times, HKIS has the ability to contact the trip sponsor or the land agent in-country. If conditions warrant, a trip may be changed or cancelled due to concerns about political stability or arising security issues. The High School Administration communicates information to the Head of School and recommends whether the Interim should proceed. The final decision rests with the HKIS Head Of School.</p>
				<p class = "mb-0">The U.S. State Department has an on-line resource at <a href = "http://travel.state.gov" target = "_blank">http://travel.state.gov</a> for assessing travel security information. Parents can use this information for trip planning and in deciding which courses to approve.</p>
