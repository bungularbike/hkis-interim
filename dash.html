						<p>The <span class = "h6">HKIS High School Interim Program</span> is a weeklong, off-campus learning experience for all High School students. The program is an integral part of the High School curriculum and a graduation requirement.</p>
						<p>Our theme for Interim 2021: “Forget what you think you know about Hong Kong and see it through fresh eyes!” We have taken the core elements of our traditional Interim program and challenge students to experience Hong Kong as never before. Students will select their five top choice trips of 40 different options offered in five genres.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Adventure in HK... like never before!</li>
							<li>Let's Get Creative!</li>
							<li>Hong Kong Culture through Fresh Eyes</li>
							<li>Real World Learning- Career Tasters</li>
							<li>Serve your Community</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Interim Marketplace will be held on November 6 during Day 9. Students will have the opportunity to attend six 10-minute Interim presentations throughout the day.</p>

				<h4>What is Interim?</h4>
				<p>Interim is a weeklong, off-campus learning experience for all four years of high school. Students select  from a range of experiences, guided by the HKIS Vision statement and structured around four attributes: Engagement, Challenge, relationships and Skills. Interim forms an integral part of the high school curriculum and participation is a graduation requirement for all high school students.</p>
				<h4>Purpose and Goals</h4>
				<p>Interim is a carefully constructed program that presents students with challenges and opportunities for personal growth. The Interim experience is designed to help students:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Build relationships and interactions with other students and faculty members.</li>
					<li>Cultivate a spirit of community.</li>
					<li>Expand exposure to diverse cultures and traditions.</li>
					<li>Work as a member of a team.</li>
					<li>Develop communication and leadership skills, self-reliance and compassion.</li>
					<li>Venture out of their physical, emotional and intellectual comfort zones.</li>
					<li>Discover new talents and interests.</li>
					<li>Gain greater self-knowledge and a richer understanding of the world around them.</li>
					<li>Grow in responsibility and independence.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class = "mb-0">The experience of Interim compels students to draw upon the values they have developed at home and school as they encounter new situations and novel challenges. Students emerge from the program with a more profound sense of self, an enriched appreciation of human diversity, and deeper insight into the faith, traditions and cultural values that inspire compassion and humility. Ultimately, participation in the program grants students the very real satisfaction that they have taken responsibility for their own learning.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "communication">
				<h4>Communication Policy</h4>
				<p>We encourage students to be immersed in their Interim experience, so we recommend that Interim sponsors collect student cell phones during the day’s activities. We appreciate your support with this, and ask that you <i>do not contact your child directly while they are engaged in activities.</i></p>
				<p>Parent contact for emergency communications during Interim week should be through Ms Lauren Fine, Associate Principal for Student Life. Ms. Fine will be in regular contact with teachers providers throughout the week of Interim and she will update the Interim websites with information as necessary.</p>
				<p>If there are any important parent communications for the student, please contact Ms. Fine and she will relay the information through the trip sponsor. Similarly, if there are any important communications from the child, they will be instructed to relay the information through the trip sponsor who will be in contact with Ms. Fine.</p>
				<h4>Before Interim Week</h4>
				<p>Please contact the trip sponsor. All relevant trip information, including trip sponsor contact info, is located on Schoology.</p>

			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "studentResponsibilities">
				<h4>Pre-Interim</h4>
				<p>Positive interaction among students, faculty, guides and local people is a hallmark of all Interim courses. It is unacceptable for students to inconvenience others, or jeopardize the safety of the group. Students must demonstrate to their Interim sponsors that they are well suited, adequately prepared, and will be supportive of the group during the duration of Interim week. If, during pre-Interim meetings and training sessions, students have not demonstrated adequate preparation and responsible behavior, they may be reassigned to a different Interim option. In such cases, additional expenses may be incurred by parents.</p>
				<h6>Pre-Interim meetings:</h6>
				<p>Students are required to attend all scheduled pre-Interim meetings and any mandatory training sessions. Failure to attend will jeopardize a student's participation in the desired course and they may be reassigned to another Interim at parent expense.</p>
				<h4>During Interim Week</h4>
				<h6>BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS: For more detailed information, please consult the online Interim Handbook.</h6>
				<p>During Interim week, students are expected to adhere to all high school rules as stated in the Student Handbook. This includes refraining from any engagement with tobacco, vaping, illegal non-prescription drugs and alcohol. Deliberate curfew violations (for overnight trips) or going to “off limits” areas will not be tolerated. Interim teachers, in consultation with the administration, have the full authority to send home a student whose conduct is unacceptable or compromises the safety of the group.</p>
				<h4>Post-Interim Week</h4>
				<p>After the week of Interim, students will culminate their experiences in the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete a 250-500 word reflection due 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, March 10, 2021.</li>
					<li>Share their newly developed skills as part of a presentation during Interim Parent Exhibition Night at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 11, 2021.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Failure to complete post Interim requirements or attend this event means that students have not completed their Interim requirements in order to earn a credit for graduation.</p>

				<h4>ACTIVITIES, EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES WITHIN EACH COURSE ARE CATEGORIZED INTO ONE OF FOUR RISK LEVELS:</h4>
				<h5>Level 1: Low risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Students have received teacher approval to operate the equipment or proceed with the activity, and</li>
					<li>Students will not be hindered or impeded while using the equipment or engaging in the activity.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Level 2: Medium risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a degree of risk of injury to a student using this equipment or engaging in this activity to the extent that all the risk cannot be eliminated;</li>
					<li>Students require a safe working space to be able to operate the equipment or engage in the activity; and</li>
					<li>Personal protective equipment may be required to further reduce the risk of injury.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Level 3: High risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a high risk of injury to the student or other persons if the equipment or procedures described in the activity are not employed in the prescribed manner;</li>
					<li>The teacher should maintain close supervision of all aspects of this activity; and</li>
					<li>There is a need for the teacher and/or student to operate in a defined area.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Level 4: Very high risk activities in which:</h5>
				<ul class = "mb-0">
					<li>There is a high risk of injury to the student or other persons if the equipment or procedures described in the activity are not employed in the prescribed manner;</li>
					<li>An injury sustained during this activity could result in a permanent disability or death;</li>

			<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "safety">
				<h4>SAFETY INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>The nature and purpose of our Interim courses may expose students to a degree of risk not typical of regular on-campus classes or activities. While courses involving physical activity and exploration are not risk-free, physical safety is of paramount importance as courses are planned and take place. All trips are rated on an Activity Risk Level to help students and parents choose appropriate trips.</p>
				<p>The following guidelines are in place for Interim trips with certain activities:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Certain adventure trips might require a diagnostic hike, test for cycling competency or fitness level.</li>
					<li>Interim courses that include water activities (SCUBA diving, kayaking, snorkeling, surfing, sailing etc), students must:
						<ul>
							<li>pass a minimum 25-meter swimming test</li>
							<li>spend appropriate ‘in-pool’ training time prior to departure</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Attendance at training sessions may be mandatory - please check individual trip information pages for more information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Interim teachers carry a first aid kit that contains typical items that might be needed. For more serious medical issues, emergency evacuation is available.</p>
				<p>Some Interim courses may have additional medical requirements. Itineraries that require rigorous physical exercise or special skills may also require mandatory pre-trip training or assessment.</p>
				<h6>As Interim sponsors need to be aware of contact information, any medical issues, physical conditions or allergies, parents are required to keep all family details and medical information updated on <a href = "https://hkis.powerschool.com" target = "_blank" style = "font-family: Futura Bold">Powerschool</a> (after logging in, look on the top left side). Completion of an additional medical form with any current and temporary information is required just prior to Interim week.</h6>

				<h4>INSURANCE INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>Students should be covered by parents’ personal insurance and a declaration signed in Powerschool.</p>
			</div>
			<!--<div class = "card-body tab-pane fade" id = "security">
				<h5>Be assured that HKIS takes the security of the trip sponsors and students very seriously.</h5>
				<p>Trip locations are chosen to politically stable regions and only after consultation with US State Department and other sources of relevant travel information. Whenever possible, first hand information about a region is given high priority, either from the teachers themselves, or through contacts with other schools or organizations.</p>
				<p>Copies of passport information, HK ID's, itineraries and emergency contact details are hand-carried by the trip sponsors with a second copy available to administrators at HKIS. Teachers are briefed about what to do in an emergency and have all direct contact information for staff at HKIS. They also have the authority to make decisions, change the itinerary, or do whatever might be necessary to ensure the safety of the students in their charge. At all times, HKIS has the ability to contact the trip sponsor or the land agent in-country. If conditions warrant, a trip may be changed or cancelled due to concerns about political stability or arising security issues. The High School Administration communicates information to the Head of School and recommends whether the Interim should proceed. The final decision rests with the HKIS Head Of School.</p>
				<p class = "mb-0">The U.S. State Department has an on-line resource at <a href = "http://travel.state.gov" target = "_blank">http://travel.state.gov</a> for assessing travel security information. Parents can use this information for trip planning and in deciding which courses to approve.</p>
